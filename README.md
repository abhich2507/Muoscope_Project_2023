#Muon Telescope Simulation and Analysis

This project involves the development of a Muon Telescope simulation using GEANT4, a powerful toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. Additionally, the analysis part is performed using CERN ROOT, a data analysis framework used widely in particle physics.
#Overview

The Muon Telescope simulation aims to image the target using detector simulation. It allows users to understand and predict the behaviour of muons passing through the setup, enabling various experimental analyses.
#Features

    GEANT4 Simulation: Accurate modeling of muon interactions within the detector.
    CERN ROOT Analysis: Data analysis toolkit for processing simulation outputs.
    Muon Tracking: Capturing trajectories and properties of detected muons.
    Visualization: Capability to visualize the simulated detector setup and muon paths.
